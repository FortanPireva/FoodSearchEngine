    <span> General food waste statistics: </span>
    <ul>
      <li>Worldwide: Around 1.3 billion tons of the world's food ends up in the trash every year.</li>
      <li>Germany: In Germany alone, around 12 million tons of food are wasted every year.</li>
      <li>Per capita: On average, we Germans throw around 75 kilograms of our food in the trash can!</li>
      <li>Private households: Around 6.7 million tons of still edible food are thrown away in German households. 
        Figuratively speaking, that's about two fully packed shopping carts with a commodity value of 234 euros per person.</li>
      <li>One in eight foods: In German households, around one in eight items of food is thrown away - 
        even though no one actually wants to waste food.</li>
      <li>Production to consumption: In fact, around one third of all food produced worldwide is lost on its way 
        from the field to the plate.</li>
    </ul>
    <span>A report by the Johann Heinrich von Thünen Institute reveals which areas are particularly responsible 
      for the shocking figures on food waste in Germany:</span>
    <ul>
      <li>Private households: About 52 percent of all food waste is generated in private households.</li>
      <li>Agriculture: Primary production accounts for about 12 percent (1.4 million tons in total).</li>
      <li>Processing: In the processing of food alone, about 18 percent - and thus about 2.2 million metric 
        tons - of food is lost.</li>
      <li>Retail: Retailers generate 4 percent (0.5 million tons) of all food waste in Germany.</li>
      <li>Out-of-home consumption: About 14 percent (1.7 million tons) of food waste is attributable to ToGo consumption.</li>
    </ul>
    <span>All of the above statistics should inspire reflection. But some of the facts also raise moral questions, 
      as food waste occurs at the expense of the planet, animals, 
      or even other people. What do we mean by that? See for yourself - here are some facts from a study by the 
      Federal Environment Agency and other organizations:</span>
    <ul>
      <li>Greenhouse gases: Every year, food waste generates more than 38 million metric tons of greenhouse gases, 
        which contribute significantly to the Climate change Contribute.</li>
      <li>Land consumption: About 43,000 square kilometers of agricultural land are tilled, only to have the food thrown away.</li>
      <li>Water consumption: About 216 million cubic meters of water are consumed in vain. This contributes 
        decisively to the Water shortage.</li>
      <li>Animal Welfare: According to the Heinrich Böll Foundation, more than four kilograms of meat and sausage 
        are wasted per capita in Germany every year. Converted to slaughter animals, 
        that's 230,000 cattle, 1,800,000 ducks, 2,700,000 turkeys, 4,100,000 pigs and 45,000,000 chickens carelessly 
        thrown into the garbage can.</li>
    </ul>
